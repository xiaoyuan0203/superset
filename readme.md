1. add the certificate and private key file to `docker/cert` and modify specific name in the `docker/run-server.sh`
certificate and private key file can be generated by 
`sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout docker/cert/selfsigned.key -out docker/cert/selfsigned.crt` 
`sudo chmod a+r docker/cert/selfsigned.key`
for test purpose.

2. python database driver can be added to `docker/requirements-local.txt`

3. SECRET_KEY for metadatabase can be appended to `docker/superset_config.py`. SECRET_KEY can be generated by `openssl rand -base64 42`

4. run `docker compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up`
